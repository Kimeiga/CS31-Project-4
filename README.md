As you gain experience with arrays, you'll discover that many applications do the same kinds of things with them (e.g., find where an item is in an array, or check whether two arrays differ). You'll find that it's helpful to have a library of useful functions that manipulate arrays. (For our purposes now, a library is a collection of functions that developers can call instead of having to write them themselves. For a library to be most useful, the functions in it should be related and organized around a central theme. For example, a screen graphics library might have functions that allow you to draw shapes like lines and circles on the screen, move them around, fill them with color, etc. In this view, the Standard C++ library is really a collection of libraries: a string library, a math library, an input/output library, and much more.)
